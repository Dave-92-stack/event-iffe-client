The Feeling IFFI application is the perfect application to create events and engage activities. This application allows users to create an account, view, edit, delete, and RSVP events. Think about it like your next hangout calendar. Need a place to create an event or looking for an event to attend? You won't need to look further, our application allows users to create events and attend other events.
